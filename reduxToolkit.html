Sure, I can give you a general idea of how to create an eCommerce website using Redux Toolkit on GitHub. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your project.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Set up a basic React application using `create-react-app`.

4. Install the necessary dependencies for Redux Toolkit:

   ```
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
   ```

5. Create a `store.js` file in your project directory. This file will contain all of your Redux Toolkit configuration.

6. Set up your Redux store using the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit.

7. Define your initial state, reducers, and actions using Redux Toolkit.

8. Create a `components` folder in your project directory to store all of your React components.

9. Create a `containers` folder in your project directory to store all of your container components.

10. Connect your container components to the Redux store using the `connect` function from `react-redux`.

11. Implement your eCommerce website functionality using React components and Redux actions.

12. Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.

These are just the general steps to create an eCommerce website using Redux Toolkit on GitHub. You will need to further customize your website to meet your specific needs and requirements. Additionally, you can find many eCommerce website templates and examples on GitHub that you can use as a starting point.
